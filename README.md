### R3G / Unity

## The aims of the project

This repository is the Unity part of the R3G project. The R3G project is a software suite for gesture recognition. This project was carried out by seven students from INSA Rennes during their fourth year. This software suite aims to help an INSA/IRISA doctoral student to develop a gesture recognition system. The Unity part of this project allows the user to create a user profile and a gesture database. It also allows him to test the performance of his recognition system. The project also includes a web application allowing him to explore, annotate the database and train the recognition system.

## Run the project

To launch the project, you need the 2019 version of Unity and a gesture sensor such as the LeapMotion, the first version of the Kinect or the second version.

## The scenes

The Unity part of R3G consists of three main scenes.

# User

This scene allows you to create a user profile. It allows you to record information such as age, weight, height and handiness.
